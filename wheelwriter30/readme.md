This is (to the best of my knowledge) an IBM Lexmark Wheelwriter30 keyboard removed from the teletype. I'm not too sure what the history of this keyboard is, and I unfortunatly threw out the rest of the typewriter. It was made in 1989, according to the sticker on the back of the keyboard.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Isaiah Grace](https://github.com/isaiahgrace)
* Hardware Supported: IBM Lexmark Wheelwriter30
* Hardware Availability: Good luck lol. I bought an entire Wheelwriter30 from my university surplus store for cheap and removed the keyboard. Maybe [govdeals.com](govdeals.com)?

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make wheelwriter30/default
